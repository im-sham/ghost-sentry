# Ghost Sentry

> **Automating the Edge for National Security.**

Ghost Sentry is an automated Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) pipeline designed to bridge the gap between passive observation and active mission tasking. It processes geospatial optical imagery (Sentinel-2) to detect tactical assets and autonomously generate cueing tasks for the Anduril Lattice ecosystem.

## Mission

In compliant environments, the volume of sensor data far exceeds human processing capacity. Ghost Sentry acts as an "Autonomous Sentry," seamlessly integrating with the **Lattice Mesh** to:
1.  **Monitor** vast areas of interest using commercial satellite imagery.
2.  **Detect** tactical assets (aircraft, vessels, vehicles) using edge-optimized AI.
3.  **Cue** high-fidelity assets for verification without human intervention.
