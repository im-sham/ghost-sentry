# Roadmap

## Phase 1: MVP (Complete) ✅
- [x] Optical imagery processing (Sentinel-2).
- [x] YOLOv8 tactical asset detection.
- [x] Lattice-compatible data modeling.
- [x] Autonomous cueing logic.
- [x] CoT XML output for interoperability.
- [x] TUI Operator Console.

## Phase 2: Active ISR & Localized Fusion (Next) 🚧
- [ ] **SAR Integration**: Add support for Sentinel-1 (SAR) imagery to enable all-weather monitoring.
- [ ] **Edge Fusion**: Implement localized sensor fusion between optical and radar feeds.
- [ ] **Degraded Mode**: Enhance resilience for operation in network-denied environments.

## Phase 3: Advanced Autonomy 🔮
- [ ] **Multi-Platform Cueing**: Enable direct tasking of autonomous assets (e.g., ALTIUS, Dive-LD) via Lattice Mesh.
- [ ] **Behavior Analysis**: Detect anomalies in movement patterns (e.g., loitering, formation changes).
- [ ] **Full Kill-Chain Integration**: Close the loop from detection to terminal engagement options within the Lattice environment.
